This repository is my personal frontend development workspace where I experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build practical skills through hands-on projects. I focus on core web technologies including semantic HTML5 markup, modern CSS layouts with Flexbox and Grid, and interactive JavaScript features like DOM manipulation and API integration. The projects range from basic exercises to small applications like to-do lists, weather widgets, and responsive website components, all designed to help me understand real-world implementation of frontend concepts. I emphasize clean code practices, accessibility standards, and performance optimization while working through challenges. This space serves as both a learning environment and a progress tracker, where I document my coding journey through detailed commits and comments. As I continue developing, I aim to expand into framework-based projects while maintaining strong fundamentals in vanilla JavaScript and CSS. The repository evolves alongside my skills, reflecting my growing ability to solve problems and create efficient, user-friendly interfaces.
